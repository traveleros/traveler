TravelerOS is a lightweight linux distribution aimed for USB drives.

## Lightweight.
TravelerOS uses KDE Plasma, a popular and lightweight desktop enviroment. Perfect for users who mostly use Windows.

## Large collection of apps.
TravelerOS is based on Q4OS, a debian based distro. So you have access to the APT package manager, and TravelerOS comes with flatpak preinstalled! Thanks to Q4OS's built in .deb installer, you can now install .deb packages without having trouble!

## Minimal.
TravelerOS is built to be minimal, so that way you have enough persistent storage on your USB drive
so that way you can store all your apps, games, and other stuff!

## System Requirements
CPU: 1 GHz or faster
RAM: 1 GB 
Storage: Depends on how much storage you have. 32 GB USB's are recommended. 
You also need a 64-bit processor.
